Simplest form of text to speech using javascript
***Important****
To see this code in action. You need to record the audio files from 'a' to 'z'
And then save it according to the word. For example 
Record the voice of you pronouncing 'a' and save it as "a.mp3' without quotes.
Same goes for all the alphabets.
Save these audio files in the public_html or else change the location in code.

It is fully customisable and easy to play with
Happy coding!! ✌️✌️
